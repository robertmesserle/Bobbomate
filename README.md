Bobbomate
=========

jQuery is great for animating DOM elements, but what about when you need to animate something that isn't a DOM element?  I rean into this problem while working with Canvas, and decided to write my own solution.

Essentially, Bobbomate does what $.animate does, but stripped down to be completely agnostic to the DOM.
